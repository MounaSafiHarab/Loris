**Imaging Uploader**

Imaging Uploader is used to upload imaging scans through the Upload tab. All scans uploaded can be browsed through the Browse tab.  
While it is used to upload scans, it can be configured to automatically launch the Loris MRI insertion pipeline on the uploaded scans.
It has a Log Viewer that includes informative messages and updates on the state of the insertion progress, and a Progress column that 
indicates the four possible states of the insertion status: 'Not Started', 'In Progress', 'Failure', and 'Success'.

Imaging Uploader also has the capability of re-uploading (overwriting) files that were wrongly uploaded, if the insertion pipeline has not been started on those.
